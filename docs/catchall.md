# Catch-All document for miscellaneous project ideas  

A place to record thoughts, ideas and notes as the project grows. 

## Tools \& Learning Opportunities  

Jinja: Templating responses  
NoSQL: Requests return JSON objects. Instead of parsing into SQL, keep as JSON
* Starting with MySQL DB to "cache" request-reponse pairs  


## Reccomendations  

### Daily  

Send notification early AM making suggestions for a successful day. 

"We reccomend a T-shirt and light jacket today. We're expecting a chilly morning with a balmy afternoon."
"Consider bringing an umbrella today."  
"The temperature is peaking particularly early today, with strong Southerly winds. Expect the weather to turn over this afternoon" 
"We're expecting a particularly nice sunset tonight." 


### Periodic  

On weekends, send suggestions to help optimize weekend activities. 

"We reccomend getting outside on Saturday. Rain is expected Sunday"
"The weather has started turning. This would be a good weekend to pull winter clothes out of storage."
"The days are cold and short, and mowing season is winding down. Consider tidying up the lawn soon" 

### Calendar-based  

TBD how the info would be supplied. Weather independent, but still handy to have reminders. 

"Because Monday is a holiday, trash service has been delayed one day this week"  
"Halloween is in 3 weeks. This would be a good weekend to start planning your costume!"  

## Integrate with Google Nest  

Google Home/Nest can be used to set standard reminders and ToDo's. It might be possible to integrate with that.
